Css Library
Bootstrap vs Materia-UI
Theme
Use SC recommended theme  or get a third party theme and change to SC colors?
Some themes I like
http://previews.aspirity.com/easydev/  looks like bootstrap theme to me (blocked by SC)
http://react-material.fusetheme.com   material with some bootstrap css
https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html bootstrap theme

UI testing Framework
Jest/Mocha/Chai

Other components
Pivot Grid
https://react-table.js.org/#/story/pivoting-options

DateTime Range Picker
https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates 

I will try and setup the AdminLTE theme for us to play around, as it is free.
